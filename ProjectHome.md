# User interface library #

## This library is here to help you with your application development. ##

There is currently no stable release in the downloads section but we will try to set one for you as soon as possible.

Right now you can start using UIScrollView libraries that will help you to build amazing effects quite similar to the application detail page in the iPhone AppStore, where you can scroll horizontally between different screenshots. This library is called **IGUIScrollViewImage**, short example how to use it can be found here: http://code.google.com/p/iphone-guru-uilibrary/wiki/IGUIScrollViewImage

The second class is quite similar to that one but you don't have to be limited by images but you can put any UIView type object in it. This class is called **IGUIScrollViewCanvas** and we are working on some nice example for you right now.

Third class will allow you to create vertical UIScrollView by just simle adding elements like UILabel, UITextView, UIImage, UIButton or again any other UIView based objects. This class will take care about everything, including correct spacing, etc ...

Everything is currently in the SVN source repository only, but as we said before, we are working on a first release.
